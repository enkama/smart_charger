## Smart Charger

Smart Charger predicts when your devices need to be charged and drives a charger switch so that everything is ready when you are. It combines battery sensors, alarm entities, and historical performance data to maintain optimal charge levels without wasting energy.

### Highlights

- Supports multiple devices with individual targets and sensors
- Optional predictive mode with learned charge durations
- Presence aware refresh, notifications, and manual override services

### Getting Started

Install via HACS by adding `https://github.com/enkama/smart_charger` as a custom repository, or copy `custom_components/smart_charger` into your Home Assistant configuration directory and restart. Add the integration through the Home Assistant UI and follow the guided setup to register your devices.
