# Ignore missing imports (Home Assistant types and other runtime-only deps)
ignore_missing_imports = True

# Note: We add an empty `custom_components/__init__.py` so mypy will treat
# it as a package and avoid the duplicate-module error that can occur when
# the same file is importable as both `smart_charger` and
# `custom_components.smart_charger` in CI environments.

# Only run mypy over the integration package itself by default. Tests in
# `tests/` use dynamic fixtures and typing patterns that produce many
# spurious errors; keep them out of the default CI mypy run to make
# incremental typing checks practical. CI can enable broader checks in a
# separate job if desired.
